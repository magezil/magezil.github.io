        <h1>Delicious food</h1>
        <p>Over the past year, I have started cooking and baking more. This page showcases some of my creations.</p>
        <h3>Turkey and cranberry sauce</h3>

        <p>Since my fiance and I started celebrating Thanksgiving together, we have been making a turkey, which we eat over the following month. It is a tradition that I really enjoy because it is fun to cook something together. Plus it is very economical and makes it easy to make meals.</p>

        <p>This past Thanksgiving (2016), I decided to try to make cranberry sauce for the first time. My family never made cranberry sauce at home, but I was amazed by the sauce I tried at a friend's house. I was very happy with how this sauce turned out.</p>
        <h3>French Toast</h3>

        <p>This is almond french toast that I made. I had just received the boat-shaped dish and thought it would be a perfect vessel to hold my french toast and syrup!</p>
        <h3>Cupcakes</h3>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/DuQUFxx.jpg" alt="Strawberry cupcakes with buttercream and vanilla frosting.">
        <p>These cupcakes were made from cake mix in a box and used store bought frosting. However, it was a lot of fun to decorate with my fiance! This was the first time we had ever used icing tips.</p>
        <h3>Cake</h3>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/JXdztpA.jpg" alt="Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and pearls to decorate.">
        <p>This cake and frosting I made with my sisters completely from scratch to celebrate their graduations. They wanted to use edible chocolate pearls to decorate the cake to make it a little fancier.</p>
        <h3>Avocado coconut chocolate chip ice cream</h3>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ejAmEPx.jpg" alt="Delicious avocado coconut chocolate chip ice cream!">
        <p>That title is a mouthful, but I wouldn't mind having my mouth full of this ice cream! This was made by mixing mashed avocado with coconut milk and chocolate chips.</p>
