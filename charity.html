        <h1>Crochet for Charity</h1>
        <p>I have started looking into donating items that I crochet to charity. The charities that I am most interested in are <strong>Project Linus</strong>, <strong>Crochet for Cancer</strong> and <strong>Bay Area Cancer Connections</strong>. Both of these non-profit organizations accept handmade items, including those made by crochet, to provide comfort to those in need and accept donations near where I live.</p>
        <h2><img src="https://www.projectlinus.org/images/logo.png" alt="Project Linus logo">Project Linus</h2>
        <p>Project Linus provides blankets to children in need. I like this organization because they support children who are seriously ill, traumatized, or otherwise in need. Just like <a href="http://ridgerooms.tumblr.com/post/9406805890/blanketsforall">Linus</a> from <i>Peanuts</i> who always had his blanket with him, I know how comforting a blanket can be. When I was growing up, I had a pillow that I took with me everywhere. I think it will be more meaningful to give a child something that helps them feel safe when they are already in a situation where they are vulnerable due to illness or trauma rather than sell the blanket instead.</p>

          <h2>Crochet for Cancer and Bay Area Cancer Connections</h2>
        <p>Both Crochet for Cancer and Bay Area Cancer Connections provide hats to cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy or other treatments. A number of patients may feel insecure because they are losing their hair so receiving the hat helps them feel more sure about themselves and keep their head warm. I also know many people who have had or currently have cancer, including people in my family.</p>
