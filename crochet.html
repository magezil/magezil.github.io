        <h1>Crochet projects</h1>
        <p>Here is a sample of projects I have created over the past three years.</p>
        <h2>Current project</h2>
        <img src="http://imgur.com/gir0i3k.jpg" alt="Not yet complete blanket of different shades of blue.">
        <p>I am currently working on this blanket using yarn that is made of different shades of blue. This project is different from my other projects because the rows are diagonal rather than horizontal across the blanket.</p>
        <h2>Finished projects</h2>
        <h3>Roses</h3>
        <div id="split">
          <img class="medium" src="http://imgur.com/9f5WAWT.jpg" alt="Small rose with two layers.">
          <img class="medium" src="http://imgur.com/fHVaLjT.jpg" alt="Large flower with three layers.">
        </div>
        <p>Here are two different sized roses that I made for Valentine's Day 2017. They are designed to be attached to a crocheted flower stem, but I decided to attach them to bobby pins and used them as hair decorations.</p>
        <h3>Silly hat</h3>
        <img src="http://imgur.com/hwjGTCy.jpg" alt="Silly hat.">
        <p>This is a hat I made based on two different patterns. The hat was based on <a href="http://www.repeatcrafterme.com/2012/09/crochet-owl-hat-pattern-in-newborn.html">this owl hat pattern.</a> I experimented with increasing and decreasing rows in order to make the rabbit ears.</p>

        <h3>Two color scarf</h3>
        <img src="http://imgur.com/lMzp8Tz.jpg" alt="Pink and aqua scarf.">
        <p>This scarf I made while learning how to "croknit" - a combination of crocheting and knitting. It is similar to tunisian crochet, in which you keep all the stitches on the crochet hook. However, with croknitting, there is a hook on both sides of the crochet hook. The video below helped me when I was learning this style.</p>

        <p>The video below demonstrates a variation of a tunisian crochet stitch: the honeycomb stitch. It was fun and interesting to create this scarf by blending croknitting with the honeycomb stitch.</p>
