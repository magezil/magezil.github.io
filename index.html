  <h2 id="about">About me:</h2>
  <p>I am currently learning web development through <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. I also have experience programming using Python, Java, C, and Javascript.</p>
  <p>I started coding when I was in high school with Java. After high school, I continued learning various programming languages for fun and to learn what other coding languages are commonly used.</p>
  <p>I want to develop my programming skills because I love creating and sharing useful tools! I want to spread greater opportunities, knowledge and resources to the people who need them. This is because my earliest memories about the world were the opportunities here, compared to all the lost opportunities, in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p>

    <li><b>Python</b> I am currently solving problems on <a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> using Python scripts. I have also programmed interactive games using Python.</li> <!-- Todo: Link (and maybe update) games from codeskulptor -->
    <li><b>HTML and CSS</b> I made this website from scratch using HTML and CSS! This is the first public website I have made from scratch, though I have previous experience building on either templates or previous work for websites.</li>
    <!-- TODO: <li><b>Skill 3</b> Nulla ullamcorper luctus nunc sed pellentesque.</li> -->
