        <h1>About Liz Magalindan</h1>
        <h3>Journey into Programming</h3>
        <p>I first learned to code in high school using Java. I quickly got hooked on programming and joined the Computer Science Club. I learned that I love collaborating to solve interesting problems.</p>
        <p>The thing I enjoy most about programming is tackling problems and figuring out how to use the available tools to solve the problem. For example, I love exploring and discovering solutions to the Project Euler problems. If I get stuck, I  research the problem to discover more properties of the math and software concepts related to the problem. I also talk to other people around me about these problems to check if my understanding is correct or if there is another way to get to the solution. In the end, I am thrilled to see the green check mark that signifies I got the right answer. Click the icon below to go to the Project Euler website.</p>

	<h3>Probably, the dog</h3>
        <p>My dog, Probably, is a dark chocolate lab mix. We used to think that she was black but recently realized that her hair is more dark brown than black. She is a rescue dog who loves food, attention, and play. Her favorite toys, in this order, are tennis balls, rope toys, and then anything else that she can destroy.</p>
        <p>She is also surprisingly patient for pictures (sometimes.) Click the image below to expand the picture of her after we watched <em>Air Buddies</em>.</p>
